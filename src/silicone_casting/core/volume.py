"""World-space volume of evaluated mesh objects.

Volume is only defined for a closed surface, so every function here
refuses to produce a number for a mesh that is not watertight rather
than returning the meaningless value ``calc_volume`` would give for an
open one. Measuring is strictly read-only: objects, meshes and the
scene are left exactly as they were found.

Like the rest of ``core``, this module stays on the data API -- no
``bpy.ops``, no ``Depsgraph.update()``, and no user-facing wording. The
caller receives object *names* and decides how to phrase them.

    The volume is measured on the temporary mesh Blender evaluates for
    the viewport, so modifiers -- the addon's Solidify among them --
    are included, while a modifier with ``show_viewport`` off is not.
    Local volume is converted to world space by multiplying with the
    absolute determinant of the object's linear transform, which is
    exact for an affine transform and, unlike transforming every vertex
    first, costs nothing per vertex and loses less precision. Taking the
    absolute value is what keeps a mirrored (negatively scaled) object
    from reporting a negative volume.

    Args:
        obj: Object to measure. Must be a mesh object and must be linked
            into the view layer, since the result comes from evaluating
            it -- both are the caller's responsibility.
        depsgraph: Dependency graph to evaluate against, typically
            ``context.evaluated_depsgraph_get()``.

    Returns:
        The volume in cubic Blender units, always non-negative, or
        ``None`` when the evaluated mesh is not watertight and therefore
        has no volume. A mesh without any edges at all satisfies the
