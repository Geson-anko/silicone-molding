"""Unit conversion and display formatting for the addon's numbers.

The addon fixes the units it speaks to the user regardless of the
scene's unit settings: wall thickness is authored in millimetres and
volume is reported in cubic centimetres (= millilitres), because those
are the languages of 3D printing and of casting silicone. Blender stores
both in its own unit system, so the conversions between the two live
here, together with the single decimal format that defines what a volume
looks like on screen and in the clipboard.

Nothing in this module may import ``bpy``: the scene's unit scale is
passed in as a plain number by the caller, which keeps every function
here a pure function that tier-1 tests can call without a scene.

    One cubic centimetre is one millilitre, which is the unit written on
    measuring cups and on tins of casting silicone. The factor is cubed
    because a volume scales with the third power of a length: one Blender
    unit is ``scale_length`` metres, hence ``scale_length * 100``
    centimetres.

    Args:
        volume: Volume to convert, in cubic Blender units.
        scale_length: Metres represented by one Blender unit, taken from
            ``scene.unit_settings.scale_length``. Blender clamps that
            property to a positive value, and this is a multiplication
            either way, so no zero guard is needed here.

    Fixed-point with two decimals is deliberate -- exponent notation and
    thousands separators would both stop the text from pasting into a
    spreadsheet as a number.
