"""World-space volume of evaluated meshes, and the aggregate over a selection.

Every expected number is derived from the 2x2x2 cube of
``tests/conftest.py`` and from the definitions in the spec (5.2, 9.2,
9.3) rather than read off a run. No golden fixture is used: this feature
emits no geometry, and the one input that comes out of Blender's own
Solidify modifier is pinned by its analytic wall volume instead (see the
spec's 9 preamble).

The degenerate inputs are built face list by face list in this module so
that "open" and "non-manifold" are visible in the test source. Their
boundary and non-manifold edge counts are asserted through
:func:`tests._helpers.mesh_invariants`, which reaches its verdict from
edge/face counts on its own -- the spec (5.2) requires that the test-side
watertight decision stay separate from the implementation's, so neither
can excuse the other.
