"""Executable spec for the sidebar's panel structure.

Source of truth: ``memory/specs/volume_measurement.md`` §5.8, acceptance
criteria AC-60 -- AC-65.

The sidebar is one header-only parent panel with three collapsible children,
``Measurement``, ``Coloring``, then ``Processing``. What a background run can
state about that structure is the class-level declaration: who the parent
is, in which order the children are drawn, and that neither child hides or
collapses itself. The contents of ``draw`` cannot be reached without a
window, so the volume result and mixture-table layout remain part of the
manual Blender check.

That registration actually accepts this parent/child arrangement (FR-8) is
asserted in ``tests/silicone_casting/test_register.py``.
