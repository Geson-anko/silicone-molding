"""Executable spec for the clipboard operator behind the result row.

Source of truth: ``memory/specs/volume_measurement.md`` §5.5, acceptance
criteria AC-50 -- AC-55.

The operator copies whatever string it is handed; it knows nothing about
volumes, which is why it is named ``copy_value`` and why it takes a single
``StringProperty`` (§5.5).

**The clipboard contents must not be asserted here** (MUST NOT, §9.5 note /
L-8): in a background run ``window_manager.clipboard`` accepts the
assignment but always reads back as an empty string, so such a test would
verify nothing. That the pasted text is exactly the displayed number is
covered by the manual check AC-76; that it is the *same* string as the one
on screen is a structural property of ``draw`` (FR-48, review item §10.4).
