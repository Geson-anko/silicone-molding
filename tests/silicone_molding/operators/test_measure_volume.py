"""Executable spec for the volume measurement operator.

Source of truth: ``memory/specs/volume_measurement.md`` §5.4, acceptance
criteria AC-31 -- AC-49.

These run against the real ``bpy`` wheel: a real scene, a real selection, a
real modifier stack and a real depsgraph. Nothing here mocks ``bpy``.

The volume arithmetic is the ``core`` layer's contract and is asserted in
``tests/silicone_molding/core/``. What these tests state is the operator
layer's own job: which selections make the sidebar button clickable, what
ends up in ``Scene.silicone_molding`` after a run, and what happens to an
already stored result when the next run cannot measure the selection.

Expected volumes are spelled as the string the panel displays, i.e. what
``format_ml`` returns, because the display is what the spec fixes; the
float32 arithmetic behind it is not (§9, tolerance policy). Report wording
is never asserted -- the spec deliberately leaves it unfixed (§5.4).
